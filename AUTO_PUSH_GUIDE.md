# Auto-Push Configuration Guide

## 🚀 Overview
Your BreathEasy repository is now configured with automatic git push functionality! Every time you commit changes to the `main` branch, they will be automatically pushed to GitHub.

## ✅ What's Configured

### 1. Post-Commit Hook
- **Location**: `.git/hooks/post-commit`
- **Function**: Automatically pushes commits on main branch to origin/main
- **Safety**: Only pushes from main branch to prevent conflicts on feature branches

### 2. Git Alias
- **Command**: `git acp "commit message"`
- **Function**: Adds all files, commits with message, and auto-pushes
- **Usage**: `git acp "feat: add new breathing pattern"`

## 💡 Usage Examples

### Standard Workflow (Auto-Push Enabled)
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement new feature"
# ✅ Automatically pushes to GitHub!
```

### Quick Workflow with Alias
```bash
git acp "fix: resolve breathing timer issue"
# ✅ Adds, commits, and auto-pushes in one command!
```

### Feature Branch Workflow (Manual Push)
```bash
git checkout -b feature/new-pattern
git commit -m "wip: working on new pattern"
# ℹ️ No auto-push (safety feature)
git push origin feature/new-pattern  # Manual push required
```

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Auto-Push Logic
```bash
# Only pushes if on main branch
if [ "$branch" = "main" ]; then
    git push origin main
fi
```

### Benefits
- ✅ Streamlined development workflow
- ✅ Never forget to push changes
- ✅ Real-time backup to GitHub
- ✅ Safe feature branch handling
- ✅ Team collaboration friendly

### Safety Features
- Only auto-pushes from main branch
- Provides feedback on push success/failure
- Preserves git history and commit messages
- Compatible with pull requests and code reviews

## 🎯 Perfect for BreathEasy Development

This setup is ideal for the BreathEasy project because:
- **Rapid Iteration**: UI/UX changes are immediately backed up
- **Asset Management**: App icons and resources are safely stored
- **Documentation**: Changelog and documentation updates are synced
- **Collaboration**: Team members always have latest changes

## 🛠️ Customization

### Modify Auto-Push Behavior
Edit `.git/hooks/post-commit` to:
- Change target branch
- Add pre-push validations
- Customize push messages
- Add build verification

### Disable Auto-Push
```bash
# Temporarily disable
chmod -x .git/hooks/post-commit

# Re-enable
chmod +x .git/hooks/post-commit

# Permanently remove
rm .git/hooks/post-commit
```

## 📋 Verification

Test the setup:
```bash
# Make a small change
echo "# Test" >> README.md

# Commit and watch auto-push
git add README.md
git commit -m "test: verify auto-push"

# Should see: "✅ Successfully pushed to remote repository!"
```

Your BreathEasy development workflow is now optimized for maximum productivity! 🧘‍♀️✨

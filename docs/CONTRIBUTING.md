### Commit Guidelines

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

#### Commit Types
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that don't affect meaning (white-space, formatting)
- `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: Performance improvement
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to build process or auxiliary tools

#### Examples
```bash
feat: add custom breathing pattern creation
fix: resolve session timer accuracy on background transition
docs: update API documentation for DataManager
style: improve breathing orb animation smoothness
refactor: extract haptic feedback logic into HapticManager
perf: optimize session data loading performance
test: add unit tests for mood tracking functionality
chore: update Xcode project settings for iOS 18.5
```

## Style Guidelines

### Swift Code Style

#### Naming Conventions
```swift
// Types: PascalCase
struct BreathingSession { }
class SessionViewModel { }
enum BreathingPhase { }

// Variables/Functions: camelCase
var sessionDuration: TimeInterval
func startBreathingSession() { }

// Constants: camelCase with descriptive names
let defaultSessionDuration: TimeInterval = 300
let maximumCustomPatterns = 10

// Private properties: leading underscore only for stored properties that back public computed properties
private var _isSessionActive = false
var isSessionActive: Bool { _isSessionActive }
```

#### Code Organization
```swift
// MARK: - File header
//
//  FileName.swift
//  BreathEasy
//
//  Created by [Your Name] on [Date].
//

import Foundation
import SwiftUI

/// Clear, concise class description
/// 
/// Detailed explanation of the class purpose,
/// key responsibilities, and usage examples.
class ExampleClass {
    
    // MARK: - Properties
    
    // MARK: - Initialization
    
    // MARK: - Public Methods
    
    // MARK: - Private Methods
}

// MARK: - Extensions

extension ExampleClass {
    // Group related functionality
}

// MARK: - Conformances

extension ExampleClass: SomeProtocol {
    // Protocol implementation
}

// MARK: - Preview (for SwiftUI views)

#Preview {
    ExampleView()
}
```

#### Documentation
```swift
/// Manages breathing session state and provides real-time updates during active sessions.
///
/// This view model coordinates the breathing session lifecycle, including:
/// - Phase timing and transitions (inhale, hold, exhale, pause)
/// - Visual animation synchronization with breathing phases
/// - Audio cues and haptic feedback coordination
/// - Session completion and data persistence
///
/// ## Usage
/// ```swift
/// let viewModel = SessionViewModel()
/// viewModel.startSession(pattern: .fourSevenEight, duration: 300)
/// ```
@Observable
class SessionViewModel {
    
    /// The current breathing phase during an active session.
    ///
    /// This property automatically updates as the session progresses through
    /// each phase of the breathing pattern. UI components observe this value
    /// to synchronize animations and visual feedback.
    private(set) var currentPhase: BreathingPhase = .inhale
    
    /// Starts a new breathing session with the specified configuration.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - pattern: The breathing pattern to follow (4-7-8, Box, etc.)
    ///   - duration: Total session length in seconds (60-1800)
    ///   - moodBefore: Optional pre-session mood rating for tracking
    ///
    /// - Note: This method immediately begins the session timer and phase transitions.
    ///         Ensure the view is ready to respond to state changes before calling.
    ///
    /// - Warning: Only one session can be active at a time. Starting a new session
    ///           while one is active will terminate the current session.
    func startSession(
        pattern: BreathingPattern,
        duration: TimeInterval,
        moodBefore: MoodLevel? = nil
    ) {
        // Implementation
    }
}
```

### SwiftUI Best Practices

#### View Composition
```swift
// GOOD: Break complex views into smaller, focused components
struct HomeView: View {
    var body: some View {
        ScrollView {
            VStack(spacing: 24) {
                headerSection
                quickStartSection
                progressSection
                recentActivitySection
            }
        }
    }
    
    @ViewBuilder
    private var headerSection: some View {
        VStack(alignment: .leading, spacing: 8) {
            greetingText
            streakCounter
        }
    }
}

// AVOID: Monolithic view bodies
struct HomeView: View {
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            // 100+ lines of inline view code
        }
    }
}
```

#### State Management
```swift
// GOOD: Use @Observable for complex state
@Observable
class HomeViewModel {
    var selectedPattern: BreathingPattern = .fourSevenEight
    var sessionDuration: TimeInterval = 300
    var isLoading = false
    
    func updatePattern(_ pattern: BreathingPattern) {
        selectedPattern = pattern
        // Additional logic...
    }
}

// GOOD: Use @State for simple view-specific state
struct SettingsView: View {
    @State private var showingAlert = false
    @State private var selectedTab = 0
}

// AVOID: Complex business logic in @State
struct HomeView: View {
    @State private var allSessions: [BreathingSession] = []
    @State private var badges: Set<BreathingBadge> = []
    // This belongs in a ViewModel or Manager
}
```

#### Accessibility
```swift
// Always include accessibility support
Button("Start Session") {
    startBreathingSession()
}
.accessibilityLabel("Start breathing session")
.accessibilityHint("Begins a guided breathing exercise with the selected pattern")
.accessibilityAddTraits(.startsMediaSession)

Text(currentPhase.displayName)
    .accessibilityLabel("Current breathing phase")
    .accessibilityValue(currentPhase.accessibilityDescription)
    .accessibilityAddTraits(.updatesFrequently)
```

### Testing Requirements

All contributions must include appropriate tests:

#### Unit Tests Required For
- **New models** - Data structures, validation, encoding/decoding
- **Business logic** - Calculations, algorithms, state management
- **Manager classes** - Data persistence, external API interactions
- **View models** - State changes, user interactions, computed properties

#### UI Tests Required For
- **New user flows** - Complete feature workflows
- **Critical paths** - Session creation, settings changes, data export
- **Accessibility** - VoiceOver navigation, keyboard support

#### Example Test Structure
```swift
import XCTest
@testable import BreathEasy

final class BreathingPatternTests: XCTestCase {
    
    func testFourSevenEightTiming() {
        // Given
        let pattern = BreathingPattern.fourSevenEight
        
        // When
        let timing = pattern.defaultTiming
        
        // Then
        XCTAssertEqual(timing.inhale, 4.0)
        XCTAssertEqual(timing.hold, 7.0)
        XCTAssertEqual(timing.exhale, 8.0)
        XCTAssertEqual(timing.pause, 1.0)
    }
    
    func testCustomTimingValidation() {
        // Given
        let validTiming = BreathingTiming(inhale: 4, hold: 2, exhale: 6, pause: 1)
        let invalidTiming = BreathingTiming(inhale: 0, hold: -1, exhale: 61, pause: 2)
        
        // Then
        XCTAssertTrue(validTiming.isValid)
        XCTAssertFalse(invalidTiming.isValid)
    }
}
```
